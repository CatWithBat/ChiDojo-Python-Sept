# ChiDojo-Python-Sept

 Welcome everyone! This is a repository to help track our progress moving through the Python track.

  Your first assignment is to figure out how to send me a **pull request** that adds a directory (use your full name as the folder name) with an `aboutMe` file (feel free to make it a .txt or .md file) inside that; feel free to add any info you want into that aboutMe file.

  Probably the easiest workflow for you is to:
  1. **fork** this repository to your own GitHub account
  2. **clone** the forked version down onto your local machine
  3. Add an additional **remote** connection to the original repository

  Now, whenever you make changes inside your personal directory, you can first **pull** any updates from the main repository to your local machine, commit your changes to the local repo, push those commits to your forked version on GitHub, and finally make a **pull request**.

 You guys will be version-control masters by the end of this course because we'll use this repository to submit and review assignments. You can take a look at our schedule here: https://docs.google.com/a/codingdojo.com/spreadsheets/d/1GH0nYkggI38vSFKYT0DD2ijZH-bc4xYEsPp9EpbZ0T8/edit?usp=sharing

 Happy coding!
